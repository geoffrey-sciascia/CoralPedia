Rather than bringing tentacles all the way to the mouth, the oral disc remains barren. The tentacles stay on the outer fringe, and there are around 200 of them. They are short and feature small ridges that make them look beaded. The center of the disc and the tentacles typically are not the same color.', warfare: 'Chemical/Physical; Anemone produce a sticky, paralysing, venomous cells called nematocysts.

They are carnivorous and will eat anything from shrimp to whole fish.', husbandry: 'One of the best things about the rock flower anemone? No two look alike. Of course, that makes attempting to tell a male and female apart tricky. Good thing the group can reproduce via sexual OR asexual methods. For sexual reproduction, the males and females spawn in autumn. They release the gametes into the water column. The fertilized eggs hatch a granula larva. The granula sinks to the bottom and finds a rock to attach to. It then develops into a polyp that continues to grow. You can also see asexual reproduction. The base will divide, producing a second oral disc. It is similar to the budding you see with coral species. The growth is usually SLOW, and it could take weeks before the new rock flower separates.', aggressiveness: 'In general, sea anemones tend to wander. When they do not like the conditions where they are living, they pick up and move on. Rock flower anemones can do the same thing, but they choose not to. They are one of the more sedentary groups out there. Burying themselves in the sand is their M.O. It is one of the reasons their ideal for beginners. You do not need to worry about implementing protective measures around the tank.', pictures: '', type: 4 },

In nature, these anemones can breed by sexual and asexual means. Sexual reproduction involves sex cells or fertilization of released eggs in the water column. It is really hard to see them spawning because it also depends on the moon cycle. Fertilized eggs produce planula larvae that settles on the sea floor and grows into a new anemone. Asexual reproduction requires only one parent which splits in half from the foot or mouth to form a copy of itself (cloning). Professional aquarists cut them in half and let them heal for a month or two. Please, DO NOT do that in your home aquarium! Without proper technic you will kill the anemone.', aggressiveness: 'This anemone anchors itself in the substrate using somehthing large already buried beneath the substrate.

In nature, the C. membranaceus reproduce sexually with the female being larger than the male. Unlike the true anemones, they do not reproduce through asexual means such as fission, where the anemone is divided or split into parts to create a new anemone. Tube Anemones are hermaphrodites, meaning they are both male and female. Although each animal can produce both eggs and sperm, they do not produce them at the same time, so it takes two specimens to produce a zygote. The Zygote is a fertilized egg, the beginnings of a new tube anemone.
